# Everyone reviews code at CYF

Mentors and trainees all review code, and collaborate on improving code quality. We are all helping each other to talk, write, and think about code more clearly.

In the Piscine, we are reviewing code before it is accepted into production. We are looking for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and ways to improve the code.

## Key points:

1. Ask questions instead of making statements:

   **YES:** "Is there another element you could use to group a set of fields in a form?"
   **NO:** "Use fieldset not divs"

2. Encourage simplicity, clarity, and precision:

   **YES** "There are 15,0000 files in this changelist. Which files should be reviewed?"
   **NO** "It doesn't matter; I can try to figure out what you meant."

3. Respect everyone's work and time:

   **YES** "I think there's some more to do here. Thanks for sharing where you're up to."
   **NO** "This is rubbish. Try harder."
