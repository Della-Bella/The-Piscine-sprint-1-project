Recommended as team projects:

- [Days Calendar](./Project-Days-Calendar)

Recommended as individual projects:

- [Shared Bookmarks](./Project-Shared-Bookmarks)
- [Music Data](./Project-Music-Data)
- [Codewars Leaderboard](./Project-Codewars-Leaderboard)

In each project folder you will find a readme with the project requirements and any setup files.

Read the docs carefully and have fun! ðŸš€
